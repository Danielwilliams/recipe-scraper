Mexican Rice 

INGREDIENTS
1 1/2 cups white rice 
3 tbsp neutral oil
1/4 onion diced
1 garlic clove crushed
1 tbsp Knorr chicken bouillon
1/2 tsp garlic powder
2 roma tomatoes 
2 cups hot water
1/4 tsp salt or to taste
3 sprigs cilantro

Instruction:
Over medium heat, add the oil to a non-stick pan, then fry the onions and garlic.
When the onions and garlic have lightly browned, remove the garlic and set it aside.
Add rice to the pot and toast the rice in the oil, moving it constantly for about 5 minutes or until it becomes slightly puffy and golden brown.
Add the Knorr chicken bouillon, garlic powder, mix and continue toasting for another minute.
 Blend together the roma tomatoes and fried garlic clove. You should have about (1 cup) of tomato sauce.
Add it to the rice, stirring constantly for 30 seconds. The color should change to warm reddish orange color. At this point, watch the heat to make sure the bottom is not burning. Adjust the heat if you need to.
Add the HOT water to the rice. It has to be hot- if the liquid isn't bubbling on the sides of the pot, your water is not hot enough. Stir in salt to taste at this point if you're adding. I recommend about 1/4 tsp salt. 
Add the cilantro on top, continue boiling over medium-low heat until some of the water has evaporated. Then turn the heat to the low and cover for 20 minutes. Do NOT lift the lid!
After 20 minutes, turn off the heat and fluff the rice with a fork. There will be a thin layer of tomato sauce at the top- that is what we want. Just gently fluff & mix it into the rice to distribute evenly.
At this point, the rice is ready if you don't like overly soft rice. But if you want it more soft & fluffy, cover for another 10 minutes (no heat). Enjoy!

Salt and black pepper, to taste
Fresh parsley, chopped, for garnish

Instructions:
1. Preheat the Oven:
Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or lightly grease it.
2. Prepare the Potato Wedges:
Cut the potatoes into wedges (about 8 wedges per potato) and soak them in cold water for 20-30 minutes. This helps remove excess starch for extra crispiness.
Drain and pat the wedges dry with a clean kitchen towel.
3. Season the Potatoes:
In a large bowl, mix olive oil, minced garlic, Parmesan cheese, paprika, oregano, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Add the potato wedges and toss until evenly coated.
4. Arrange on Baking Sheet:
Place the seasoned potato wedges on the prepared baking sheet in a single layer, skin-side down.
5. Bake:
Bake for 35-40 minutes, flipping halfway through, until the wedges are golden brown and crispy.
6. Serve:
Sprinkle the baked potato wedges with additional Parmesan cheese and chopped parsley. Serve hot with your favorite dipping sauce (like ranch or garlic aioli).
These Baked Garlic Parmesan Potato Wedges are crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, and bursting with garlicky, cheesy flavor. A perfect side dish or snack! 🥔🧄🧀
