# Recipe Formatting Instructions

This document provides guidelines for formatting recipes from FB Recipes.txt into a standardized JSON format for import into the recipe database.

## Target Format

Each recipe should be formatted as a JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "title": "Recipe Title",
  "ingredients": ["Ingredient 1", "Ingredient 2", ...],
  "instructions": ["Step 1", "Step 2", ...],
  "source": "Facebook",
  "source_url": "",
  "date_scraped": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.sssZ",
  "complexity": "easy|medium|complex",
  "metadata": {
    "prep_time": minutes,
    "cook_time": minutes,
    "total_time": minutes,
    "servings": number,
    "cuisine": "type"
  },
  "nutrition": {
    "calories": number,
    "protein": number,
    "carbs": number,
    "fat": number,
    "fiber": number,
    "sugar": number,
    "sodium": number,
    "per_serving": {
      "calories": number,
      "protein": number,
      "carbs": number,
      "fat": number,
      "fiber": number,
      "sugar": number,
      "sodium": number
    },
    "per_meal": {
      "calories": number,
      "protein": number,
      "carbs": number,
      "fat": number,
      "fiber": number,
      "sugar": number,
      "sodium": number
    }
  },
  "image_url": "https://example.com/image.jpg",
  "tags": ["tag1", "tag2", ...],
  "raw_content": "original recipe text"
}
```

## Processing Steps

1. **Title Extraction**:
   - Extract the title from the first line of each recipe
   - Remove emojis and special characters
   - Keep title under 95 characters

2. **Ingredients Section**:
   - Look for "Ingredients" or similar headers
   - Extract all ingredients, preserving the line-by-line format
   - For grouped ingredients (e.g., "For the Sauce:"), maintain the original formatting

3. **Instructions Section**:
   - Look for "Instructions", "Directions", or similar headers
   - Extract all steps, preserving the line-by-line format
   - Remove step numbers but maintain step ordering

4. **Metadata Extraction**:
   - Extract prep time, cook time, total time if available
   - Extract servings if available
   - Extract cuisine type if available
   - Determine complexity based on ingredient count and instruction steps:
     - ‚â§5 ingredients AND ‚â§5 steps: "easy"
     - ‚â•12 ingredients OR ‚â•8 steps: "complex"
     - Otherwise: "medium"

5. **Nutrition Information**:
   - Extract calories, protein, carbs, fat if available
   - Generate nutritional information if not available using a nutrition API or AI estimation
   - Calculate per serving values by dividing total nutritional values by serving count
   - Calculate per meal values based on standard meal portion (typically 1 serving but may vary based on recipe type)
   - For per_meal calculation, use the following assumptions:
     - Main dishes: 1 serving = 1 meal portion
     - Side dishes: 2-3 servings = 1 meal portion
     - Desserts: 2 servings = 1 meal portion
     - Snacks: 1-2 servings = 1 meal portion

6. **Image URL Processing**:
   - Extract image URL if present in the recipe (look for http/https links)
   - If no image URL is present, generate one using one of these methods:
     1. **API Search**: Use Unsplash API, Pexels API, or similar to search for images using the recipe title and main ingredients
        ```
        API_KEY=your_api_key
        QUERY="Recipe Title main ingredient"
        curl -H "Authorization: Client-ID $API_KEY" \
        "https://api.unsplash.com/search/photos?query=$QUERY&per_page=1"
        ```
     2. **Web Scraping**: Search for images on recipe websites using the recipe title
        ```python
        import requests
        from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
        
        def find_image(recipe_title):
            search_url = f"https://www.google.com/search?q={recipe_title}&tbm=isch"
            response = requests.get(search_url, headers={'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0'})
            soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
            img_tags = soup.find_all('img', limit=5)
            return img_tags[1]['src'] if len(img_tags) > 1 else None
        ```
     3. **AI Image Generation**: Use AI image generation APIs like DALL-E or Stable Diffusion
        ```
        POST https://api.openai.com/v1/images/generations
        {
          "prompt": "Photo of [Recipe Title], food photography, high quality",
          "n": 1,
          "size": "512x512"
        }
        ```

7. **Tags Generation**:
   - Extract hashtags if present in the recipe
   - Generate standardized tags based on recipe title, ingredients, and cuisine
   - Standard tag categories for Smart Meal Planner:
     - **Meal Type**: breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack, dessert
     - **Cuisine**: italian, mexican, asian, mediterranean, american, etc.
     - **Diet Type**: vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, keto, low-carb, etc.
     - **Dish Type**: soup, salad, sandwich, pizza, pasta, stir-fry, etc.
     - **Main Ingredient**: chicken, beef, fish, tofu, lentils, etc.
     - **Cooking Method**: baked, grilled, fried, slow-cooker, instant-pot, etc.
     - **Preparation Time**: quick, make-ahead, meal-prep
   - Always include "facebook" as a source tag
   - Add dietary tags (vegetarian, vegan, etc.) based on ingredients analysis

8. **Recipe Separation**:
   - Look for common separators between recipes:
     - Lines of dashes/underscores (e.g., "________")
     - Numbered recipes (e.g., "1. Recipe Name")
     - Double line breaks between recipes

## Implementation

For implementation, follow these steps:

1. Read the FB Recipes.txt file
2. Split the content into individual recipes using the separation rules
3. For each recipe:
   - Process and extract all components mentioned above
   - Generate missing components (nutrition, images, tags)
   - Format into the JSON structure
4. Save the formatted recipes to a JSON file for import

## Additional Notes

- **Nutrition Calculation APIs**:
  - USDA FoodData Central API: https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/api-guide.html
  - Nutritionix API: https://developer.nutritionix.com/
  - Edamam Nutrition API: https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-nutrition-api
  - Example API call:
    ```
    curl -X GET "https://api.edamam.com/api/nutrition-data?app_id=YOUR_APP_ID&app_key=YOUR_APP_KEY&ingr=1%20large%20apple"
    ```

- **Image Search APIs**:
  - Unsplash API: https://unsplash.com/documentation
  - Pexels API: https://www.pexels.com/api/documentation/
  - Pixabay API: https://pixabay.com/api/docs/
  - Example Unsplash API call:
    ```
    curl -H "Authorization: Client-ID YOUR_ACCESS_KEY" https://api.unsplash.com/search/photos?query=pasta%20salad
    ```

- **Tag Generation**:
  - Use NLP techniques to extract key ingredients, cooking methods, and cuisine types
  - Match extracted keywords against a predefined list of standard tags
  - For dietary analysis, maintain lists of:
    - Meat/animal ingredients (for vegetarian/vegan detection)
    - Gluten-containing ingredients (for gluten-free detection)
    - High-carb ingredients (for keto/low-carb detection)
    - Dairy ingredients (for dairy-free detection)

- Limit raw_content to 5000 characters
- Generate a unique ID for each recipe
