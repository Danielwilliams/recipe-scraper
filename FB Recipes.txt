Cabbage wedges roast in the oven, then are slathered with a lemon- and garlic-infused butter that seeps into the crevices of each leaf. 
Ingredients
 ‚ÅÉ 1 medium head green cabbage
 ‚ÅÉ 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
 ‚ÅÉ 1 1/2 teaspoons grated lemon zest
 ‚ÅÉ 1 tablespoon lemon juice
 ‚ÅÉ 1/4 teaspoon salt
 ‚ÅÉ 5 tablespoons unsalted butter
 ‚ÅÉ 2 teaspoons grated garlic
 ‚ÅÉ 1 teaspoon garlic salt
 ‚ÅÉ 1 teaspoon salt-free lemon-pepper seasoning
 ‚ÅÉ 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper
 ‚ÅÉ Chopped fresh flat leaf parsley for garnish (optional) 
 ‚ÅÉ Lemon wedges for serving (optional)
Directions
 1. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with foil; place in oven. Preheat the oven to 400¬∞F. Remove any wilted or damaged leaves from cabbage. Cut the cabbage into 8 (1 1/4-inch) wedges, leaving the root end intact to help the wedges stay together.
 2. Brush both sides of the cabbage wedges with oil and lemon juice; sprinkle with salt.
 3. Remove the baking sheet from the oven; arrange the cabbage wedges on it in a single layer. Roast until tender and slightly browned, 40 to 45 minutes, flipping halfway through.
 4. Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat, about 1 minute. Stir in lemon zest, garlic, garlic salt and lemon-pepper. Spoon or brush the mixture evenly over both sides of the roasted cabbage (about 1 1/2 teaspoons per side). Return the cabbage wedges to the oven; roast for 5 minutes more.
 5. Sprinkle crushed red pepper evenly over the cabbage wedges. Garnish with parsley and serve with lemon wedges, if desired.

Sweet Potatoes Filled with Roast Turkey and Cranberry Sauce
Ingredients:
For the Sweet Potatoes:
3 large sweet potatoes
For the Turkey (if not using leftovers):
2 lbs turkey breast (bone-in, skin on)
1 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon dried basil
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 cup chicken broth
1/2 cup water
For the Cranberry Sauce (if not using leftovers):
3 cups fresh or frozen cranberries
Zest and juice of one large navel orange (with water added to make 1 cup total)
1/3 cup pure maple syrup
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup water
1/3 cup pecans, chopped
Instructions:
Preheat the Oven:
Preheat your oven to 425¬∞F (220¬∞C). Scrub the sweet potatoes under cool water and pierce them all over with a fork. Wrap each potato in foil and place them on a small baking pan.
Prepare the Turkey:
In a separate baking pan, place the turkey breast. Season it with sea salt, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and dried basil. Pour lemon juice over the turkey and add chicken broth along with 1/2 cup of water to the pan. Place both pans in the oven side by side. Roast for about 1 hour or until the sweet potatoes are soft and the turkey reaches an internal temperature of 165¬∞F (74¬∞C) on a meat thermometer.
Make the Cranberry Sauce:
While the potatoes and turkey are roasting, prepare the cranberry sauce. In a small saucepan, combine all ingredients except for 1/2 cup of cranberries. If using fresh cranberries, rinse and discard any wrinkled ones, then add the rest to the pan. If using frozen, add them directly. Stir and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 5-8 minutes, or until most berries have popped. Stir in the remaining cranberries and let cool.
Stuff the Sweet Potatoes:
Once the sweet potatoes are done, cut each in half and allow them to cool slightly. Use a fork to fluff the potato flesh inside the skin, creating a well for the turkey. Add about 5 ounces of shredded turkey to each potato half and top with 3 tablespoons of cranberry sauce. Place the stuffed potatoes back in the oven for 5 minutes to heat through.
Serve:
After heating, sprinkle each stuffed sweet potato with 1 tablespoon of chopped pecans. Serve warm and enjoy!

Place the salmon pieces in a large bowl. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper (if using).
Toss gently to coat the salmon evenly with the seasoning.

‚Ä¢ 1 teaspoon onion powderüßÖ
‚Ä¢ Salt and pepper to tasteüßÇ
‚Ä¢ Olive oil for frying
‚Ä¢ 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese (optional)üßÄ
Instructions:
1. Start by grating the zucchini and carrots.
2. If using spinach, chop it finely.

4. In a large bowl, combine the grated zucchini, carrots, chopped spinach, flour, Parmesan cheese (if using), eggs, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper.
5. Mix everything until well combined.
6. In a large skillet, heat about 1/4 inch of oil over medium heat. You can test if the oil is hot enough by dropping a small amount of the batter into the oil; it should sizzle.
7. Drop spoonfuls of the vegetable mixture into the hot oil, flattening them slightly with the back of the spoon.
8. Fry for about 3-4 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and crispy.
9. Do not overcrowd the pan; you may need to work in batches.

1 can refrigerated biscuit dough.
1/2 tsp garlic powder.
1/2 tsp Italian seasoning.
