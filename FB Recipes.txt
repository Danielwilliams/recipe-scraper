Cabbage wedges roast in the oven, then are slathered with a lemon- and garlic-infused butter that seeps into the crevices of each leaf. 
Ingredients
 ⁃ 1 medium head green cabbage
 ⁃ 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
 ⁃ 1 1/2 teaspoons grated lemon zest
 ⁃ 1 tablespoon lemon juice
 ⁃ 1/4 teaspoon salt
 ⁃ 5 tablespoons unsalted butter
 ⁃ 2 teaspoons grated garlic
 ⁃ 1 teaspoon garlic salt
 ⁃ 1 teaspoon salt-free lemon-pepper seasoning
 ⁃ 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper
 ⁃ Chopped fresh flat leaf parsley for garnish (optional) 
 ⁃ Lemon wedges for serving (optional)
Directions
 1. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with foil; place in oven. Preheat the oven to 400°F. Remove any wilted or damaged leaves from cabbage. Cut the cabbage into 8 (1 1/4-inch) wedges, leaving the root end intact to help the wedges stay together.
 2. Brush both sides of the cabbage wedges with oil and lemon juice; sprinkle with salt.
 3. Remove the baking sheet from the oven; arrange the cabbage wedges on it in a single layer. Roast until tender and slightly browned, 40 to 45 minutes, flipping halfway through.
 4. Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat, about 1 minute. Stir in lemon zest, garlic, garlic salt and lemon-pepper. Spoon or brush the mixture evenly over both sides of the roasted cabbage (about 1 1/2 teaspoons per side). Return the cabbage wedges to the oven; roast for 5 minutes more.
 5. Sprinkle crushed red pepper evenly over the cabbage wedges. Garnish with parsley and serve with lemon wedges, if desired.

Sweet Potatoes Filled with Roast Turkey and Cranberry Sauce
Ingredients:
For the Sweet Potatoes:
3 large sweet potatoes
For the Turkey (if not using leftovers):
2 lbs turkey breast (bone-in, skin on)
1 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon dried basil
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 cup chicken broth
1/2 cup water
For the Cranberry Sauce (if not using leftovers):
3 cups fresh or frozen cranberries
Zest and juice of one large navel orange (with water added to make 1 cup total)
1/3 cup pure maple syrup
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup water
1/3 cup pecans, chopped
Instructions:
Preheat the Oven:
Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). Scrub the sweet potatoes under cool water and pierce them all over with a fork. Wrap each potato in foil and place them on a small baking pan.
Prepare the Turkey:
In a separate baking pan, place the turkey breast. Season it with sea salt, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and dried basil. Pour lemon juice over the turkey and add chicken broth along with 1/2 cup of water to the pan. Place both pans in the oven side by side. Roast for about 1 hour or until the sweet potatoes are soft and the turkey reaches an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C) on a meat thermometer.
Make the Cranberry Sauce:
While the potatoes and turkey are roasting, prepare the cranberry sauce. In a small saucepan, combine all ingredients except for 1/2 cup of cranberries. If using fresh cranberries, rinse and discard any wrinkled ones, then add the rest to the pan. If using frozen, add them directly. Stir and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 5-8 minutes, or until most berries have popped. Stir in the remaining cranberries and let cool.
Stuff the Sweet Potatoes:
Once the sweet potatoes are done, cut each in half and allow them to cool slightly. Use a fork to fluff the potato flesh inside the skin, creating a well for the turkey. Add about 5 ounces of shredded turkey to each potato half and top with 3 tablespoons of cranberry sauce. Place the stuffed potatoes back in the oven for 5 minutes to heat through.
Serve:
After heating, sprinkle each stuffed sweet potato with 1 tablespoon of chopped pecans. Serve warm and enjoy!

Crispy Bang Bang Salmon Bites
Ingredients:
For the Salmon Bites:
- 1 1/2 pounds salmon fillets (skin removed, cut into bite-sized pieces)
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional, for extra heat)
For the Bang Bang Sauce:

- 1 tablespoon sriracha sauce (adjust for preferred heat level)
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 1 tablespoon lime juice (freshly squeezed)
Optional Garnish:
- Fresh parsley or cilantro, chopped
- Green onions, sliced
- Sesame seeds
Directions:
Step 1: Prep the Salmon
Pat the salmon fillets dry with paper towels to ensure a crispy texture. Remove any skin and cut the salmon into 1-inch bite-sized cubes.
Place the salmon pieces in a large bowl. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper (if using).
Toss gently to coat the salmon evenly with the seasoning.
Step 2: Make the Bang Bang Sauce
In a small mixing bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, Thai sweet chili sauce, sriracha, honey, and lime juice until smooth and creamy.
Taste and adjust the sauce—add more sriracha for heat or honey for sweetness. Set aside.
Step 3: Cook the Salmon
Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat and add a small amount of olive oil to prevent sticking.
Once the oil is hot, add the salmon pieces in a single layer, making sure not to overcrowd the pan. Work in batches if needed.

This Fiery Chicken Ramen has everything you love—tender, caramelized chicken, rich garlicky broth, and perfectly slurpable noodles. A little spice, a little creaminess… trust me, it’s heaven in a bowl.
Let’s do this!
What You’ll Need
For the Chicken
2 fresh chicken breasts, diced
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon chili sauce (go as spicy as you like!)

1 teaspoon paprika
2 tablespoons olive oil

Let’s Make It!
Step 1: Marinate the Chicken
In a bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, chili sauce, and honey. Toss in the diced chicken, making sure every piece is coated in that bold, sweet heat. Let it sit for at least 30 minutes—or longer, if you have the time. The longer, the better!
Step 2: Sear the Chicken

Step 3: Garlic & Spice Time
Toss in the minced garlic and paprika, stirring for another minute. This is where the flavor really deepens—your kitchen is about to smell amazing.
Step 4: Simmer the Broth & Noodles
Pour in the chicken broth and bring it to a gentle boil. Add the ramen noodles and cook for 3 minutes, just until they’re tender. They’ll soak up all that delicious, garlicky broth—trust me, this is next-level ramen.
Step 5: Make It Creamy
Turn the heat to low and stir in the heavy cream. Let it simmer for 5 minutes until the broth is silky, rich, and just thick enough to coat your spoon.
Step 6: Serve & Enjoy!
Ladle the ramen into bowls, top with fresh green onions, and dig in. The combination of spicy chicken, creamy broth, and fresh crunch is pure comfort food perfection.

Step-by-Step Instructions
Step 1: Prepare the Sauce
In a small bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, hoisin sauce, sriracha, honey, rice vinegar, garlic, ginger, and cornstarch.
Ensure the cornstarch is fully dissolved to prevent lumps when cooking.
Step 2: Brown the Beef
Heat the sesame oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.

Drain any excess fat if necessary.
Step 3: Add the Sauce
Reduce the heat to medium.
Pour the prepared sauce over the cooked beef.
Stir well and cook for 3–4 minutes, until the sauce thickens and coats the beef evenly.
Step 4: Garnish and Serve

Common Mistakes to Avoid
❌ Overcrowding the Pan – This can cause the beef to steam rather than brown. Cook in batches if necessary.
❌ Skipping the Cornstarch – This is key for thickening the sauce and helping it cling to the meat.
❌ Not Draining the Fat – Too much fat can make the dish greasy.
❌ Adding Sauce Too Early – Add the sauce after the beef is fully browned to prevent burning.

Storing Tips for the Recipe
Refrigeration: Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
Freezing: Freeze in a sealed container for up to 3 months.
Reheating: Reheat on the stovetop over medium heat, adding a splash of water if the sauce thickens too much.

5-Minute Air Fryer Chicken Alfredo Bombs
Ingredients:
1 cup shredded cooked chicken.
1 cup Alfredo sauce.
1 cup shredded Mozzarella cheese.
1 can refrigerated biscuit dough.
1/2 tsp garlic powder.
1/2 tsp Italian seasoning.
1/4 tsp black pepper.
1/4 cup melted butter.
Instructions:
Start by preheating your air fryer to 375 degrees F. While the air fryer is preheating, in a medium-sized bowl, combine the shredded chicken, Alfredo sauce, and half the Mozzarella cheese. Stir until all the ingredients are well combined. 
Take out the refrigerated biscuit dough and flatten each biscuit. Place a spoonful of the chicken mixture in the center of each biscuit. Fold the biscuit dough over the chicken mixture and pinch the edges to seal it. Repeat the process for all the biscuits. In a small bowl, mix together the garlic powder, Italian seasoning, and black pepper.
Brush each chicken bomb with the melted butter, then sprinkle the seasoning mixture on top. Place the chicken bombs in the air fryer basket, leaving some space between each one for air circulation. Cook for about 5 minutes or until golden brown. Once done, sprinkle the rest of the Mozzarella cheese on top of each chicken bomb and let it melt.
